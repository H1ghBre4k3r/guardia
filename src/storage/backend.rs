/// Trait for persistent storage backends
///
/// All storage backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Parquet, etc.) must
/// implement this trait. The trait is designed to be:
///
/// - **Async**: All methods are async for compatibility with Tokio
/// - **Batch-oriented**: `insert_batch` is the primary write method
/// - **Queryable**: Support time-range queries for dashboards
/// - **Maintainable**: Health checks and cleanup operations
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// Implementations must be `Send + Sync` as they will be used
/// across async tasks.
///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// Methods return `StorageResult<T>` which wraps `StorageError`.
/// Implementations should convert backend-specific errors to
/// `StorageError` variants.

    /// - Use transactions for atomicity
    /// - Batch SQL statements for efficiency
    /// - Handle partial failures gracefully
    ///
    /// ## Performance Target
    ///
    /// Should handle 1000+ metrics in <100ms on modern hardware.

    /// # use guardia::storage::{StorageBackend, schema::MetricRow};
    /// # async fn example(backend: &dyn StorageBackend, metrics: Vec<MetricRow>) {
